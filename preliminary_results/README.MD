# 225 Years of Copyright Registrations

This repository provides reproducible data and code for the Tulane Law Review article *225 Years of Copyright Registrations*. To reproduce the tables in the main text, use RStudio to run `step_1_data_prep.R`, then compile the `main_text_results.Rmd` file using the RStudio's `knit` command.

OLS and Cochrane-Orcutt results are easily obtained by modifying the `estimation_technique` argument of the `make_tables` function in the `step_2_data_analysis.R` file.

If, after viewing the comments in the code, you have any questions, please direct your questions to Zvi Rosen (zvi @ zvirosen.com) or Richard Schwinn (richardschwinn @ gmail.com).

# In order to reproduce the findings in the main paper, please do the following
 
1. Download the repository from this link: 
https://github.com/RSchwinn/copyright/
(You may need to register. Don’t worry, it and everything else related to this project code, is free.)
 
2. Download and install R, from https://cloud.r-project.org/, and RStudio, from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download.
 
3. After both R and RStudio are installed, unzip the repository from step (1), if it was not automatically unzipped, and open the file `copyright.Rproj`.
 
4. From the "Files” panel, select and open `step_1_data_prep.R` and run each line of code in the file (in order). To run a line of code, put the cursor on a given line and click the RUN button (or press **CTRL+ENTER** on PC or **COMMAND+ENTER** on MAC). To run more than one line at a time, highlight additional lines of using **SHIFT** on your keyboard or use your mouse.
 
5. Next, select and open `step_2_data_analysis.R` and run each line of code in the file.

6. Finally, `open main_text_results.Rmd` and press the KNIT button. There is a ball of yarn next to the KNIT button.
